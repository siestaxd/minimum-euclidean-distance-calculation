# Minimum Euclidean Distance Calculation

**IBM and Kodluyoruz: CyberStart Bootcamp Week 2 Assignment**

## Overview

This project is part of the IBM and Kodluyoruz "CyberStart" Bootcamp, specifically for the Week 2 assignment. The task is to create a Python program that calculates the minimum Euclidean distance between points in a 2D plane. This exercise helps to understand and apply basic Python programming and mathematical concepts.

## Objective

Implement a Python function to calculate the minimum Euclidean distance between any two points in a given list of 2D coordinates.

## Background

The Euclidean distance between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) in a 2D plane is calculated as:

\[ d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \]

## Task

1. **Input:** A list of points in a 2D plane, where each point is represented as a tuple \((x, y)\).
2. **Output:** The minimum Euclidean distance between any two distinct points in the list.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No additional libraries are required, only the standard math library.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/siestaxd/minimum-euclidean-distance-calculation.git
cd minimum-euclidean-distance-calculation
```
2. Run the Python script with your input data:
```sh
python calculate_min_distance.py
```
